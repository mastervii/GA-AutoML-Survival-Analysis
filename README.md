## Abstract
This repository hosts the program code for the Genetic Algorithm-based Auto-ML System described in our paper. Survival analysis methods focus on predicting the time until the occurrence of an event (e.g., death) for each subject, handling censored values of the target variable. Our work presents the first Auto-ML system specifically designed for survival analysis, utilizing a Genetic Algorithm. In our experiments with 9 biomedical datasets, the system demonstrated higher predictive accuracies compared to three established baseline survival analysis methods.
